Here are the instructions for making a new branch PER ISSUE in your GitHub repository:
1. **Navigate to Your Repository**
   - Go to your repository on GitHub: [swbn1/CDSpecCollab_COSC4012020-FA24](https://github.com/swbn1/CDSpecCollab_COSC4012020-FA24).
   - Open your terminal (on macOS or Linux) or Command Prompt (on Windows).

2. **Clone the Repository (if not already done)**
   - If you haven't cloned the repository to your local machine, do so: (If you are writing code you probably have this)
     git clone https://github.com/swbn1/CDSpecCollab_COSC4012020-FA24.git
     cd CDSpecCollab_COSC4012020-FA24

3. **Create a New Branch**
   - To create a new branch, use the `git checkout -b`followed by the name of your issue with your name
     git checkout -b the-name-of-your-issue-Gus

After you fix your issue, this is how you will push it back to the main
     git add .
     git commit -m "Fixed this issue: [This is a short discription of what i fixed]"
     git push origin the-name-of-your-issue-Gus

After this you will need to do a pull request for the push
   - Go to your repository on GitHub.
   - You should see a prompt to create a pull request for the newly pushed branch. Click on the "Compare & pull request" button.
   - Fill in the details for the pull request, making sure to reference the issue number in the description (e.g., "Fixes #5").
   - Submit the pull request for review.
