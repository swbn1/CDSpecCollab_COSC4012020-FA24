# Project Overview
The Circular Dichroism Spectrometer (CD Spec) project is a database that allows users to upload, save, and retrieve molecular data for research purposes. The database shall be constructed within a web application accessible by multiple parties across multiple web browsers, both mobile and desktop. The application will be accessible and utilized by administrators and instructors, registered students, as well as the general public. Account roles will be designated as either that of administrator, student, or public status. Data uploaded to the applicationâ€™s database will be designated by the uploader as either visible to the general public and all other parties or only visible to students and administrators.
