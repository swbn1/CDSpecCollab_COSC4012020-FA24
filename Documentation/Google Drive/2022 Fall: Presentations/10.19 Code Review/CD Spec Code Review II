● Looked over SDP to make sure everything is up to date and wording is the same
throughout the document.
● Downloaded github and docker on my system
```
What’s next

```
● Finish the slides from R&D guide to figure out how to use docker

## Jack Eskay- CDSpec Team Lead

### Work completed this week

- Finished commenting .py files for the CDspec deployed version
- Competed .py file completion record for QA
- Discussed and began to create chart representing how each of .py files are linked/run

### together in lucidchart

### Example .py file I commented

- Manage.py
- Works as the manager file which ensures

### that django is installed and running as

### default environment for program

- Uses try catch to inform user if django

### has been installed and used or not


## Andrew Kivrak - CDSpec RD

- Finished commenting .py files for the CDspec deployed version tests

### Example .py file I commented

- Test_urls.py
- This code manages and test the urls
- It uses assertions to get the details,
- Update, and redirect the urls by
- Reversing and resolving


## Sosan Wahid - CDSpec RD

Work Completed:

```
● Completed commenting the deployed version of CDSpec .py files.
```
Work in Process:

```
● Complete the chart that shows how each .py files are connected to each other.
```
Example of .py file commented by me:

Forms.py

```
● This code implements the generic form
for viewing CPSec models.
● This code allows to upload a form which
follows specific fields that have been
mentioned in the fields, it also allows to
edit specific fields.
