**1\. Introduction**

**1.1 Purpose**

The purpose of this Software Test Plan (STP) document is to detail any and all test cases associated with the Circular Dichroism Spectrometer (CD Spec) application. All plans and specific steps that will be taken during the testing process shall be documented here. This document will be utilized by both the R\&D and Q\&A teams to test all possible cases within the scope of the CD Spec application.

**1.2 Scope**

This STP document pertains to the CD Spec application project and all of its associated files and documentation.

**1.5 System Overview**

The Circular Dichroism Spectrometer (CD Spec Spec) software shall be a functional database housed within a constructed web application. This software shall be utilized by both instructors and students to monitor spectral changes in structure between protein-DNA interactions. Users of this web application shall be able to create three forms of accounts. These accounts include a public user account, a student user account, and an administrator account. Each account type shall have specific abilities and/or limitations imposed. A public user may only view submitted protein-DNA data, they may not edit the data in any way or submit data themselves. A student user may view and submit protein-DNA data, they may not edit the data in any way. An administrator has full functionality, meaning that they may view, submit, and edit all data within the database. 

This CD Spec software shall perform calculations within the backend in order to monitor changes and differences between the data within the database.

**3\. Testing Approach**

Black Box Testing

Members of the CD Spec team shall test the functionality of the CD Spec application. The team will test all possible requirements that have been implemented into the application. Tests will include higher priority/core functions such as:

* Application Access (in various testing environments/browsers)  
* Account Creation  
* Data Search  
* Data Upload, valid and invalid files  
* Data Graphing

White Box Testing 

* Database functionality 

Clear Box Testing 

* Application File Deciphering

**4\. Test Process**

**Unit Testing**

Testers will test each function of the CD Spec application individually to ensure that they function correctly. Unit testing is the first stage of testing and will be done to ensure that the next stage of testing, the integration stage, can combine the pieces of the program together into a more finalized product. Unit testing will be done primarily to ensure that the application is able to at least run and display the implemented interfaces.

**Integration Testing**

Integration testing will be performed to “bring all the pieces together”. This stage of testing will deal with user interface functions and making sure that interfaces are functional and the user can navigate the interfaces smoothly.

**Validation Testing**

This stage of testing will deal with testing on a broader scale. Does the application satisfy all or most of the requirements requested by the client? At this stage, the application will be tested for completeness as well as functionality.

**System Testing**

The application at this stage will be tested within different testing environments by several different members of the team. The application must function in different web browsers as well as by different users.

**5\. Reporting and Corrective Action**

Errors found will be recorded on the error log document. The errors will then be directly reported to the development team as well as the project leader. From there the QA team will work on finding and reporting more errors while the development team resolves the errors that we have reported.

**Test Number:** 01  
**Author:** Q\&A Team  
**Date:** October 22, 2020  
**Revision:** 1.0  
**Test Purpose:** This test is intended to test the functionality of the user registration and login menus.  
**Test Procedures:**

1) A user with public level access will be added to the database through the registration page.  
2) The team will attempt to log in using the newly created account’s credentials. Each account will be logged in multiple times to ensure that it persists in the database’s memory.  
3) More accounts of the same access level will be created and logged in with to ensure that the database is capable of properly registering multiple users.  
4) Steps 1 through 3 will then be repeated with student access level and administrator access level accounts.

**Measure of Success:**  
All accounts should be able to use for login, taking the user to the home page once the login is completed.
