1. **How do you envision this application?**    
   1. Exportation of the data without data loss or skewed data   
   2. ability to focus on different reading types  
2. **What do you need this application to do for you?**    
   1. Graph comparison and overlays.  
3. **What would you like the user interface to look like?**   
   1. UI simplistic with good site visuals and backgrounds  
   2. See decent amount of detail on the data, but keep it simple  
   3. Quick ui response time  
   4. Overlapping graphs for comparison purposes

4. **Specifically, what would the graph interface look like? Should it be one large graph or should it be organized within tabs?**  
5. **Do you want the user to be able to toggle which data from the files are visible on the graph?**  
     
6. **How would you like to be able to navigate through the graph(s)?**  
7. **What are the different variations that the cd spec can do to measure molecules and enzymes**

8. **How much information would like the interface to provide?**  
   1. Wavelength and Signal   
   2. voltage if above 600   
   3. Tempr  
9. **Which existing website do you expect this application to be the most similar to?**  
   1. Excel  
10. **Should the user be able to view multiple files at one or only one at a time?**  
    1. Potentially helpful, so yes  
    2. Ability to see multiple graph info  
11. **Do you want a way to download the info**  
    1. Yes  
12. **What should the graph interface look like**  
    1. Ways to point to certain aspects of the graph lines   
    2. Zoom functionality: view specific points in detail  
    3. Graph manipulation (add/subtract data for viewing/comparing purposes)  
13. **Would you like ways to filter data**  
    1. Yes  
14. **In what way should the data be filtered?**

15. **Would you like to be able to organize data w/ examples**  
    1. Yes, view by date is helpful  
    2. Name  
    3. Specific enzymes  
16. 

**Relating to the graphs of the data**

(Amber) student will typically use excel to graph after exporting data from Jasco

**Amber’s use of excel graphing for data**

- issues with format of raw data  
- getting it into excel properly

**\*\* Data to graph or use \*\***

- x, wavelength  
- y, signal, how much is absorbing  
- Report voltage, if \> 600

**\*\* PARAMETERS of importance \*\***

- voltage parameter  
- sometimes user’s change temp (this is notable)  
- timeframe (temporal scale)  
- sometimes change magnet

**\*\* Extra features\*\***

- Each txt,csv file represents a separate instance of a molecule  
- Different color lines for different molecules, to compare, each image is a molecule  
- Compare multiple datasets, different lines  
- be able to highlight specific coordinate pair, (wavelength, absorbance)  
- organize by date
