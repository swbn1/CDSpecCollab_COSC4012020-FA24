**Q: What is the multi graph feature and how do I use it?**

A: The multi graph feature allows the user to select multiple uploaded data from the database and create a graphical representation for each on the same graph.

To graph multiple data, simply click on the sets of data you wish to graph and proceed to select the multgraph option on the home page.

**Q: I have selected multiple data files to graph but cannot proceed to the graph display page. Is this a bug?**

A: No. Certain files cannot be graphed together if their parameters or contents are different. Incompatible files cannot be graphed simultaneously with the multi graph feature.

\_\_

**Q: How many sets of data can I graph at once?**

A: You may graph as many graphs that are able to multi-graphed as you like. The only constraints are the types of graphs that are allowed to be graphed together (must have similar or same parameters)
