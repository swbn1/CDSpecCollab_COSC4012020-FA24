**Usage:**

**R\&D:** 

1. Find .py file you are going to comment  
2. Check off that file from the table to indicate it is being worked on  
3. When you finish commenting, check the ‘Done’ box  
4. If you can’t finish commenting, check the ‘Teamwork’ box and move on to a different file  
5. Once all of the files have either ‘Done’ or ‘Teamwork’ checked, as a team go through the ‘Teamwork’ files and mark them as ‘Done’ once re-commented

**QA:**

1. Find .py files which have their ‘Done’ box checked off  
2. Trace these files to the requirements they fulfill based off their titles and R\&D’s comments  
3. When traced, check off the ‘QA Trace’ column

**HOMEMADE:** Code likely created or added to greatly by capstone class; errors likely here
