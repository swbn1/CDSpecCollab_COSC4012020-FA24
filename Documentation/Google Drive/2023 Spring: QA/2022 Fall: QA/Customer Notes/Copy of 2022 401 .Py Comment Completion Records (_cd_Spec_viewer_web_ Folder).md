  
“PXX”, where “XX” is some number, are .py files also found in the deployed version  
“APXX,” where “XX” is some number, are additional .py files not found in the deployed version.

Note: Some auto-generated .py files have been omitted due to redundancy.

Notes Keywords:  
**MildDiscrep**: The cd\_spec\_viewer\_web variant differs mildly from the “Deployed” folder variant  
**MajorDiscrep**: The cd\_spec\_viewer\_web variant differs a lot from the “Deployed” folder variant  
**UNUSED**: Seemingly unused .py file from last class, probably just carried over from cookiecutter  
**HOMEMADE:** Code likely created or added to greatly by capstone class; errors likely here
