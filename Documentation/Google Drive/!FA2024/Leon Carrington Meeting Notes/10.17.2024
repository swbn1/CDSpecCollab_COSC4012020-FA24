- 2 versions of CDSpec
    - Deployed version running at OIT
    - Spent a lot of time trying to get a test version of the software on a local machine,
       so there are 2 versions
    - Infrastructure issues– live one borrows some credentials from SMCM (we can’t
       access those)
- Local needs Docker, Windows 10, system is Linux based so need Linux subsystem
- Setup document so that you can run CDSpec on a laptop
- Someone needs to take over admin function to push changes to the website & create
    account for everyone- system administrator
       - Admin credentials are in R&D to do document
- Talk to Jordan(music major) about final report
- Pushing changes to the official website– either have to get authorization from Mark
    Fleming to manage the instance or set a time to push changes to the official site- most
    likely be a system administrator
- Will Capon– able to get access to push changes
- Administrative level issues– docker version they were using is gone, should be able to
    function, use docker in order to run an instance of cdspec on your personal computer
    (test version), needs access to linux subsystem
- Nginx- fine web server, too ambitious at the beginning, attempts to deploy various
    technologies overlapped was way too ambitious
- Nginx is web server as choice, built in web server with Django but not robust, Gunicorn
    creates an issue
- Simon wants to swap to Apache
    - Not too difficult to swap Nginx and Apache, Nginx as opposed to Apache not
       super important
- CDSpec is designed by one article- answers to why cookie cutter, why ngnix, without a
    big hassle replace nginx with apache
- If you run into an issue with Django being too intertwined, contact him and talk to simon
    cause it was a hike the first time
- Cookiecutter connected to Gunicorn, management portion of the mail functionality,
    CDSpec heavily dependent on mail
- Gunicorn and/or CookieCutter related to security
    - Involved in providing a self hosted certificate server in the local version
    - In the live version licensed by smcm- some sort of maintenance issue (HUGE
       MAINTENANCE ISSUE)- but OIT is a mess
    - Things are so bad they have to use AWS, implies it could go either way, job of
       getting certificate servers easy or harder
    - Monetary issue, comes out of OIT budget
- Architecture issue- might be required to be SMCM certificate server
- The certificate server license is paid for by SMCM and is not always kept up to date.
    That also will prevent logging in.
- Main issues are mail authentication, when you log into cdspec and create spectrometer
    files, everything works fine but when you try to come back it will not let you in


- When you log in it wants to send you your password, but it sends your password to a
    command prompt window and you need to have a cmd window open
- Will tried to authenticate at the network level, ran into a deprecated OAuth, took a look,
    realized Google wasn't going to keep the technology (broke on March 30)
- Login process using school domain authentication, reason why OIT has to be involved
- Recommendation now is to pursue the idea of having our app use 2 factor authentication
    for which we can use an app we will register with google in order for the app to provide
    the authority needed, not going to break
- Consider getting a small program that will be recognized as authentication by google
- Need admin password in Docker instance, admin password is in R&D to do
